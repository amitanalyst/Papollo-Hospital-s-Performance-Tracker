# Papollo-Hospital-s-Performance-Tracker

This project presents a comprehensive data analytics dashboard developed to monitor and improve the performance of Papollo Hospital. Using a combination of Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project extracts meaningful insights from hospital data to assist in better decision-making, patient care, and operational management.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Python: Used for data cleaning, formatting, and initial exploration. Libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib were used.
SQL: Utilized to perform advanced querying on hospital databases, filter patient records, and aggregate key metrics like revenue, diagnosis count, and occupancy rate.
Power BI: The core tool used to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. It helps stakeholders understand trends and KPIs through rich visuals.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

To track patient data including admit date, discharge date, and follow-up appointments.
To monitor bed occupancy across various departments: Private, General, and ICU.
To analyze doctor-wise feedback volume, helping identify performance and engagement levels.
To categorize patients based on diagnosis types (e.g., Viral Infection, Malaria, Typhoid, etc.).
To compare billing amounts vs. health insurance claims, enabling better financial planning.
To build a centralized dashboard that enables real-time hospital performance monitoring.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features

Patient Journey Tracking: Admit date, discharge date, and follow-up status visualized clearly for continuity of care.
Bed Occupancy Monitoring: Live count and trend analysis of occupied beds across ICU, General, and Private wards.
Doctor Feedback Volume: Interactive charts showing how many feedback entries each doctor has received.
Diagnosis Insights: Distribution of various diagnosis types with patient volume and trend comparisons.
Billing & Insurance Comparison: Breakdown of billing amount vs. amount covered under health insurance across disease types.

âœ… Outcomes

Improved transparency in hospital operations
Identified diagnosis types leading to higher billing vs. lower insurance coverage
Helped management evaluate doctor performance using real feedback data
Enabled better patient follow-up monitoring to reduce readmissions
